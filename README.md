This web application works a a dictionary with the help of the Free Dictionary API. https://dictionaryapi.dev
Deployed site -> https://dictionary-kempen.netlify.app

After building this project in vanilla JavaScript with a lot of appending, setting Attributes and creating new elements,
I already missed how easy and faster it is in React to create new Elements with the help of JSX Elements! :'D
I still wanted to do this project in vanilla JS just to train my vanilla skills and get better at them.
In the end building this dictionary was a lot of fun and felt really rewarding! :)
